Description: Provides functions for querying, retrieving and analyzing
        protocol- and results-related information on clinical trials from
        two public registers, the 'European Union Clinical Trials Register'
        ('EUCTR', <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>) and
        'ClinicalTrials.gov' ('CTGOV', <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>). The
        trial information is transformed and stored in a database ('SQLite' 
        or 'MongoDB', via 'nodbi'). Functions are provided to identify de-
        duplicated records, to easily find and extract variables (fields)
        of interest even from complex nesting as used by the registers, 
        and to update previous queries that users retrieved in a database. 
        The package can be used for meta analysis and trend-analysis of
        the design and conduct as well as results of clinical trials.
